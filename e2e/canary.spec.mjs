/**
 * Canary tier — "did the site change?"
 *
 * Runs against the live monkeytype.com, so it needs network and is allowed to
 * be flaky. It is deliberately *not* part of `yarn e2e`: a failure here
 * usually means Monkeytype shipped a redesign, which calls for re-recording
 * the snapshot and revisiting the adapter, not for reverting whatever was just
 * committed.
 *
 * Assertions stay coarse on purpose. The test words are generated per session,
 * so nothing about their content can be pinned — only that the selectors the
 * adapter depends on still find something, and that the overlay still comes up.
